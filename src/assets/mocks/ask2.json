                "content": "\n<think>\nOkay, I need to rewrite the user's question to make it better for vectorstore retrieval. Let me start by understanding the original question: \"Give me the distribution of discovery projects across various phases of the R&D pipeline of PFIZER.\" \n\nThe user wants to know how Pfizer's discovery projects are spread out through the different stages of their R&D pipeline. The key points here are \"distribution,\" \"discovery projects,\" \"phases of R&D pipeline,\" and \"PFIZER.\" \n\nFirst, I should consider synonyms or related terms that might help in retrieval. Instead of \"distribution,\" maybe \"breakdown\" or \"distribution across phases\" could work. Also, \"R&D pipeline\" can sometimes be referred to as \"R&D lifecycle\" or just \"R&D stages.\" \n\nI should make sure that the question is as clear as possible. The original mentions \"discovery projects,\" so maybe specifying \"phases\" as \"various stages\" might be better. Including \"PFIZER\" is important, but maybe \"of PFIZER\" could be phrased as \"for Pfizer\" to sound more natural.\n\nAnother angle to think about is if there are any specific phases in the R&D process that are commonly referred to, like preclinical, clinical trials (Phase I-III), and post-approval. Including terms like \"phases such as preclinical, clinical trials, and regulatory review\" might help the vectorstore pick up on those keywords, making the search more precise.\n\nAlso, the user might be looking for quantitative data, so phrases like \"current breakdown\" or \"current distribution\" could be better because they emphasize the need for current information. \n\nWait, should I include all the phases explicitly? Maybe listing them ensures that the retrieved documents cover all stages. But if I list them, does that limit the search to only those phases? Or does it help in pulling the right documents that mention those terms? Probably the latter.\n\nPutting it all together: \"What is the current breakdown of Pfizer's discovery projects across each stage of their R&D pipeline, including phases such as preclinical development, clinical trials (Phase I-III), and regulatory review?\" \n\nThis version specifies \"current\" to get the latest data, uses \"breakdown\" instead of \"distribution,\" and lists specific phases to improve keyword matching. It also uses \"their R&D pipeline\" to tie it directly to Pfizer. That should help the vectorstore retrieve relevant documents by including more specific keywords and structure.\n</think>\n\n**Improved Question:**  \n\"What is the current breakdown of Pfizer's discovery projects across each stage of their R&D pipeline, including phases such as preclinical development, clinical trials (Phase I-III), and regulatory review?\"  \n\n### Key Enhancements:  \n1. **Specificity:** Explicitly lists common R&D phases (preclinical, clinical trials, regulatory review) to improve keyword matching.  \n2. **Clarity:** Uses \"breakdown\" instead of \"distribution\" to emphasize categorization by stage.  \n3. **Temporal Context:** Adds \"current\" to prioritize up-to-date information.  \n4. **Structure:** Organizes phases systematically to align with industry terminology.  \n5. **Ownership:** Clarifies \"their R&D pipeline\" to avoid ambiguity about the organization.  \n\nThis version is optimized for semantic search by incorporating technical terms and explicit phase descriptors, ensuring precise retrieval of relevant documents.",
